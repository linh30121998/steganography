\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Main Content}
In this section, we compare a variety of schemes that employs noisy regions in eventual bit-planes of an digital image to hide secret bits to improve the visual quality of stego-images and the security of the hidden data. Secret bits are extracted from the patient information in the medical image respectively. \\[0.2cm]
\indent As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overviewSystem}, the common proposed system is used for different embedding methods, which is demonstrated by steganographic schemes. The purpose of this system is storing and giving back sensitive information (such as patient names, identification numbers, dates of birth, phone numbers, etc.). In which a secret message, which is extracted from a dicom image of patients, is transformed into binary format and then encrypted by AES \cite{b1}. After that, these encrypted data are embedded into the selected digital image by linear or nonlinear algorithms (which is described in Section 3.2). \\[0.2cm]
\indent Input for this application is the digital image which is converted DICOM image containing image and patient details together. The pre-processing step converts the .dcm file into generalized file format like jpeg, bmp, png etc, and also perform the following operation: \\[0.2cm]
\indent 1. Viewing the patient details and DICOM image in the software. \\
\indent 2. Extracting the patient details from the DICOM image. \\
\indent 3. Extracting the pixel data from the DICOM image. \\
\indent 4. Converting .dcm file into the chosen file format with a suitable size. \\
\indent 5. Saving the patient details into text file. \\[0.2cm]
\indent After data embedding, the stego-image is then saved in the Public Image Storage, which keep image as the original version. To guarantee that only authorized people can extract the hidden message, the generated key, which is used in the data encryption process. Therefore, an attacker cannot recover the unseen sensitive information from stego-images without the knowledge of encrypted secret key. \\[0.2cm]
\indent In the embedding process, the image regions are adaptively selected to use. The region selection is executed based on the  two parameters, the capacity of image and the number of hidden data. The estimation process plays an important role to find out the best positions which are available to carry all bits of the given message. Steganography has proven to be one of the practical ways of securing data. In this part we will survey the general principles of hiding secret information using image technology, and provide an overview of current functions and techniques.

\subsection{Steganographic techniques}\label{steTechniques}
Steganography has a long history of been used as a way to protect security and privacy of valuable information. While cryptography focuses on protecting the secret message by jumbling its content, steganography concerns on protecting the secret message by concealing its mere existence. The concealment of secret messages is achieved by embedding them into other seemingly-innocent host mediums. Figure~\ref{fig:steTechnique} below illustrates the basic idea of any steganography process.
\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{Fundamental scheme of steganography process.}\label{fig:steTechnique}
\end{figure}
Depend on the type of the cover object there are many suitable steganographic techniques which are followed in order to obtain security. Taking the cover object as medical image in hiding information is known as image steganography. Generally, in this technique pixel intensities are used to hide the information. Image steganography terminologies are as follows:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./image/steganoImage}
	\caption{Steganography in medical images.}\label{fig:steganoImage}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \indent \textbf{Cover-Image:} Original image which is used as a carrier for hidden information.
	\item \indent \textbf{Message:} Actual information which is used to hide into images. Message could be a plain text or some other image.
	\item \indent \textbf{Stego-Image:} After embedding message into cover image is known as stego-image.
	\item \indent \textbf{Stego-Key (optional):} A key is used for embedding or extracting the messages from cover-images and stego-images.
\end{itemize}
\indent Image steganography is method of information hiding into cover-image and  generates a stego-image and is currently ubiquitous in a great deal of fields such as secure data communication, healthcare and military, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:steganoImage}. \\[0.2cm]
\indent Image steganography techniques can be divided into following domains: spatial domain method, transform domain technique, distortion techniques, masking and filtering. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \indent \textbf{Spatial Domain Methods}: There are many versions of spatial steganography, all directly change some bits in the image pixel values in hiding data. Least significant bit (LSB)-based steganography is one of the simplest techniques that hides a secret message in the LSBs of pixel values without introducing many perceptible distortions. Changes in the value of the LSB are imperceptible for human eyes. Spatial domain techniques are remarkable such as least significant bit (LSB), pixel value differencing (PVD), edges based data embedding method (EBE), random pixel embedding method (RPE), etc. 
	\item \indent \textbf{Transform Domain Technique}: This is a more complex way of hiding information in an image because various algorithms and transformations are used on the image to hide information in it. By contrast, the process of embedding data in the frequency domain of a signal is much stronger than embedding principles that operate in the time domain. Most of the strong steganographic systems today operate within the transform domain due to an advantage over spatial domain techniques which is the ability to hide information in areas of the image that are less exposed to compression, cropping, and image processing. Transform domain techniques are broadly declared into: Discrete Fourier transformation technique (DFT), Discrete cosine transformation technique (DCT), Discrete Wavelet transformation technique (DWT), Lossless or reversible method (DCT) and embedding in coefficient bits. 
	\item \indent \textbf{Distortion Techniques}: These techniques need knowledge of the original cover image during the decoding process where the decoder functions to check for differences between the original cover image and the distorted cover image in order to restore the secret  message. The encoder adds a sequence of changes to the cover image. So, information is  described as being stored by signal distortion \cite{b2}. However, the need for sending the cover image limits the benefits of this technique. In any steganographic technique, the cover image should never be used more than once. If an attacker tampers with the stego-image by cropping, scaling or rotating, the receiver can easily detect it. In some cases, if the message is encoded with error correcting information, the change can even be reversed and the original message can be recovered [3].
	\item \indent \textbf{Masking and Filtering}: By marking an image, in the same way as to paper watermarks, these techniques embed the information in more significant areas than just hiding it into the noise level. The hidden message is more integral to the cover image. Watermarking techniques can be applied without the fear of image destruction due to lossy compression as they are more integrated into the image. This method is much more robust than LSB replacement with respect to compression since the information is hidden in the visible parts of the image but there is a limitation in the capacity when techniques can be applied only to gray scale images and restricted to 24 bits. 
\end{itemize}
\indent Many Steganography schemes for images are proposed. However, the best self-evident and furthermore the most surely understood method for concealing data in pictures is the least significant bit insertion technique in which only the LSB bit planes are replaced with the secret data \cite{b1}. Due to the simplicity of the LSB Steganography scheme it is very easy to detect the data by attackers. It is because of payload embedding which is common for all pixels. To overcome the problem many different techniques have been proposed where the payload is different for each pixels and the bit replaced positions also have changed. Some methods basing on LSB bit planes used for both gray scale and color images are introduced in the next section. To achieve better visual quality of stego-image it takes care of noise sensitive area for embedding basing chaotic functions like logistic map, cat map, standard map. The strength of proposed method is its integrity of secret hidden information in stego-image and high hidden capacity. These methods are also targeted to achieve high hidden capacity plus security of hidden message.  
\subsection{Chaos-based Steganography schemes}
As explained in Section~\ref{steTechniques}, we consider the mathematical form of a chaotic map. Chaos means a state of disorder. In mathematics, map is an evolution function that shows some sort of chaotic behavior \cite{b4}. A discrete time dynamical system is also called map. Chaotic map has some inherent features \cite{b5} such as:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sensitive to initial conditions (also called butterfly effect) which means a small modification in initial conditions should produce high deviations of the corresponding output.
	\item Ergodicity implies the output has the	same distribution for any input.
	\item Deterministic means a deterministic process can cause a pseudo-random behavior.
	\item Structure complexity signifies a simple mathematical function has very high complexity.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure*}[t!]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,height=4cm]{./image/overallSteganoAlgorithm}
\caption{Overall block view of the proposed steganography algorithm.}\label{fig:overallAlgorithm}
\end{figure*}
The overall view of the proposed steganography technique is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overallAlgorithm}. \\
\indent Firstly, the simplest form of chaotic system, which is developed by May \cite{b6} is logistic map described in Equation~\eqref{eq:logisticmap}.
\begin{align}
x_{n} = \alpha.x_{n-1}(1-x_{n-1})
\label{eq:logisticmap} 
\end{align}
Here \(x_{0}\) is initial value and n value denotes the number of rounds. 1D logistic map generate chaotic sequences only of the \(\alpha\) value must be in the range of \(3.5 \leq \alpha \leq 4\)\cite{b7}. It produces chaotic sequences within the range [0, 1]. By using these chaotic sequence only, the position of pixels in the cover image are chosen for embedding the bits of secret information. Step by step procedure of the steganography technique using logistic map is illustrated below. \\[0.2 cm]
DATA EMBEDDING PHASE: \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 1:} Select the patient information m and cover image C. Encrypt hide information using AES and convert the result to binary format before the embedding implementation. \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 2:} Choose the initial value, system parameter value and iteration value such as \(x_{0}\), \(\alpha\) and \(r_{p}\) respectively of 1D logistic map for generating the chaotic sequence. \[X = \left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, ..., x_{n}\right\}\] where n is the result of multiplying the two-sided dimensions of the cover image. \\[0.2 cm]
\textbf{Step 3:} Sort the generated chaotic sequence X as follows. \[\left[sx_{i}, ax_{i}\right] = sort(X_{i}), i = 1,2,3,...,N,\] where \(sx\) is a new sorted sequence of X, \(ax\) is a new index value of the series X. \\[0.2 cm]
\textbf{Step 4:} Split the 1st and 2nd bit planes of the cover image and convert these bit planes in one-dimension arrays.\\[0.2 cm] 
\textbf{Step 5:} The binary value of secret information m are divided into groups G of two consecutive bits and each group with \(ith\) index could replace bits in the 1st and 2nd bit plane corresponding position \(a_{i}\). Algorithm for embedding process is described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \indent bitPlane1 (1,M x N) - the 1st bit plane of the cover image, where M and N denotes rows and columns of the images.
	\item \indent bitPlane2 (1,M x N) - the 2nd bit plane of the cover image.
	\item \indent m (len) - the message include patient's information in the binary format and len - value is the length of message.
\end{itemize}
\indent \indent \indent \textbf{For i = 1 : len / 2} \\[0.2cm]
\indent \indent \indent \indent BP(1, M x N) = Replaced 2-LSB of cover image BP(1, \(ax_{i}\)) into G (i); \\
\indent \indent \indent \indent // BP: 2-LSB of cover image\\
\indent \indent \indent \indent // G: groups of two bit\\
\indent \indent \textbf{End} \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 6:} Convert two arrays into two-dimensions bit planes respectively with size of cover images, then two bit planes are added back to the matrix of cover image so as to be considered as stego-image. \\ [0.2cm]
\indent Hence, secret message has embedded in to cover image and finally the stego-image is transferred to the storage. Creator securely communicates the secret key and \(\alpha\) value to the decoder. \\[0.2cm]
DATA EXTRACTION PHASE: \\[0.2cm]
\indent The secret message from the stego-image can be retrieved only by using the extracting algorithm. Using the same predictor and membership function the predicted errors are calculated. \\
\textbf{Step 1:} Generate the chaotic sequence using 1D logistic map and sort it by using the same procedure in embedding process. After sorting new index value (\(ax\)) is obtained, which is used for extracting the bits in random manner. \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 2:} Split and convert the 1st and 2nd bit planes into 1-dimension arrays BP' of stego-image C'. \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 3:} Extraction of secret message for stego-image C'(M x N) M and N are rows and columns of stego-image. \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 4:} Extracting bits from stego-image. \\[0.2cm]
\indent \indent \textbf{For i = 1 : len / 2} \\
\indent \indent	\indent \indent ES(len) = Extract 2 LSB from BP'(\(ax_{i}\)); \\
\indent \indent	\indent \indent // ES = Extracted Stego-Image \\
\indent \indent \textbf{End} \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Step 5:} Combining groups of 2 bits into message and finally, convert it into ASCII format to read information of the patient. \\[0.2cm]
\indent Regarding the second method, we consider the mathematical form of a 2D chaotic map \(f : S^{2} \rightarrow S^{2}\). This map is described by the following equation:
\begin{align}
(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) = f(x_{i}, y_{i}),
\label{eq:2dchaoticmap} 
\end{align}
where \((x_{i}, y_{i})\) and \((x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})\) are the old and new states, respectively. There are a number of different chaotic maps which seem to be suitable for ciphering purposes. However, the only maps of interest are those which are simple so that the ciphering/deciphering phases can be performed quickly. In fact, the maps used in the chaos-based cryptosystem include: Henon map, Lozi map, Duffiggs map, Cat map, Baker map and Standard map. As compared in \cite{b8}, the 2D Cat map has good statistical characteristics and the highest performance. Figure~\ref{fig:Catmap} describes the scheme of the proposed embedding process in medical images based on the 2D Cat map, which represents a nonlinear embedding algorithm.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./image/Catmap}
	\caption{The scheme steganography base on the Cat map.}\label{fig:Catmap}
\end{figure}
The new bit's position is calculated as follows function ~\eqref{eq:2dchaoticmap}. Here, \(F: [0,N - 1]^{2} \rightarrow [0,N - 1]^{2}\) is the discrete Cat map defined as:
\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
			x_{i+1} = mod(x_{i} + a \times y_{i}, 1) \\ 
			y_{i+1} = mod(b \times x_{i} + a \times b \times y_{i}, 1)
	\end{split}
\label{eq:2dchaoticmap} 
\end{align}
DATA EMBEDDING PHASE \\[0.2cm]
In the embedding process the medical image and the patient information, which is known as the secret data, is selected. Secret data is converted to binary form. We make use of Cat map function with an appropriate set of initialization values and a proper iteration number to calculate two coordinates of the pixel location which is used to insert bits. Similar to step 6 in the previous method, we perform 2-bit substitution, respectively at position coordinates have been determined. \\[0.2cm]
DATA EXTRACTION PHASE \\[0.2cm]
The secret message from the stego image can be retrieved only by using the extracting algorithm by using the same initial values and Cat map function. The inserted pixel location is calculated again by using 2-dimensions map corresponding. This algorithm provides extreme sensitivity as well as security. \\[0.2cm]

\caption{Embedding and extracting process in mixing method based on logistic map and cat map.}\label{fig:mixingMethod}
\end{figure*}
\indent Another approach is the likelihood to consolidate the strategies of information hiding by using both the 1-dimension an 2-dimensions function which are known as logistic map and cat map, respectively. The later is used to find the pixel position to insert bits and the former plays an important role in deciding the order of the replaced bits. This method is shown in Figure  not only conserves the image quality but also increases the security of the information.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\

\end{center}
\end{table}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
